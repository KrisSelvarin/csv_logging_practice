# DRIP Simulator OOP

A Python program that simulates a **Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRIP)** for two sample stocks ‚Äî **CITICORE ENERGY REIT CORP. (CREIT)** and **RL COMMERCIAL REIT INC. (RCR)** ‚Äî using an **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** approach.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** This is a **noob-level project** created purely for learning and mastery of Python and OOP concepts.  
> It is **not** intended for real-world financial decision-making.

## ‚ú® Features
- Two preloaded stocks:
  - CREIT
  - RCR
- Uses OOP structure with:
  - `Name` class for company/ticker info
  - `Stock` class for stock data and info display
  - `Market` class for stock management
  - `User` class for investment input
  - `Calculation` class for DRIP math and CSV logging
- Dividend pay-out frequency:
  - Monthly
  - Quarterly
  - Bi-Annually
  - Annually
- Supports fractional dividend reinvestment
- Saves dividend logs to a CSV file
- Displays a clear investment summary

## üìå How It Works
1. **Menu** ‚Äî Choose a stock (CREIT or RCR) or view their details.
2. **User Input** ‚Äî Enter monthly investment amount and investment duration.
3. **Simulation** ‚Äî Program calculates shares bought, dividends received, and reinvestments.
4. **CSV Export** ‚Äî Dividend log saved automatically.
5. **Summary** ‚Äî Displays ROI, total shares, and final portfolio value.
